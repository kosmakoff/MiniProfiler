This is unofficial clone of Mini Profiler

I'm going to perform some activity in order to decouple AdoNet related stuff from the core project and to implement it as a module.

Yes, I'm going to implement modularized architecture in this project, so that anyone can easily extend miniprofiler with any DB support.

Why am I doing that? To get it work with MongoDB - it will be the second module (or plugin) for miniprofiler (remember first is ado.net support module).

(More notes will be added later)
